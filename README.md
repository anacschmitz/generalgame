# generalgame
Final project from my Logic introduction subject in college!
Our professor asked us to create or simulate a game from "real life", using our subjects topics learned during our first semester of Developing and Analises System course. The topics include if/else conditions, looping (for and while), lists management and functions. 

The General is a game dice and it uses a cup to raffle 5 dices units and them, get the player results!
Normally, it takes 13 rounds and at the end, who has the highest score wins!
In each round, the player could raffle the dices trhee times and at the second and third round, they have to choose to play one, twom, three, four or all dices again, so, the thing is, you have to challange your own luck!
There are 8 score rules and each player have to chose one in each round to validate their choice!

There are many code lines I should writte better but, I'm in the beggining of my path. Hope you like it !
